<h1>Weekly Pogress Report</h1>

<h2>Week1 (17/04/2022)</h2>
<ul>
<li> 
Work: launch the personal website, finish the 2nd check of FYP manuscript
</li>
<li> 
Learning: Markov Decision Process (From Random variable to the MDP), Game Theorem review (Char. 1)
</li>
</ul>
</html> 

<h2>Week2 (24/04/2022)</h2>
<ul>
<li> 
Work: Final revision of FYP manuscript, ready to submit
</li>
<li> 
Learning: Dynamic Programming, Game Theorem review (Char. 2), OOP in python
</li>
</ul>
</html> 

<h2>Week3 (01/05/2022)</h2>
<ul>
<li> 
  Work: FYP final report submission, co-work paper (with Yanpeng) manuscript </br>
  attending 1st APORS Youth Forum as audience (interested in Andy Chow's @CityU HK & Yukun Cheng's @Suzhou UST research)
</li>
<li> 
  Learning: Monte Carlo Control & Time Difference (SARSA, Q-Learning, Expectation SARSA) </br>
  Q-learning: coding work, including frame and coding (with numpy & pandas) </br>
  Game Theorem review (dynamic game of complete info)
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Week4 (08/05/2022)</h2>
<ul>
<li> 
  Work: FYP presentation slides </br>
</li>
<li> 
  Learning: SARSA: coding work, including frame and coding (with numpy & pandas) </br>
</li>
<li> 
  P.S. I tried to understand the DQN (Not just editing scripts for the task), but faced some trouble... </br>
  Before, I took CS229 @Stanford by Andrew Ng and artificial neural network course @UESTC, but seems still a little challenging for me :( </br>
  I plan to go back to Coursera Machine Learning course and Deep learning course to improve my practice understanding. </br>
  Thus, the DRL theory study will be deferred till I finish the ML & DL courses (Although I think I will take theses courses at GT as well). </br>
